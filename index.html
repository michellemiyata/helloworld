        <p>I encountered a challenge when setting up my GitHub page quickly. It took me approximately 10 minutes to
        navigate through the settings, pages, and branch to get it operational. However, I managed to overcome this
        hurdle eventually.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, prior to this experience, I was unaware that GitHub could be utilized for hosting personal
        websites. Having previously relied on paid services like Bluehost, discovering this functionality was both
        surprising and enjoyable. Creating my own site and understanding the process of uploading content proved to be a
        rewarding exercise.</p>

        <p>Moving forward, I plan to utilize my GitHub page as a portfolio platform, showcasing my academic work and
        projects post-graduation.</p>
